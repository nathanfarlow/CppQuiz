  Welcome to the C++ quiz! (Although some of the peculiarities have their origins in C)
  Let's start easy. What does the above code print? All of the C++ examples in this quiz
  will be compiled with g++ -std=c++17. (If undefined, select 'Undefined behavior'. If the
  code would not compile, select 'Compilation error')
answers:
  - 0
  - 1
  - -1
  - Undefined behavior
  - Compilation error
correct: 4
explanation: >
  It is possible for C++ structs to inherit from C++ classes. In fact, the only difference
  between structs and classes is the fact that member variables are private by default in a
  class and public by default in a struct. Because val_ was private in MyClass, it will remain
  private in whatever class/struct inherits from it, leading to a compilation issue by trying
  to access it in main.
